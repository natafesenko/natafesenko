### ***About me**
I chose a not easy profession for myself. But system administration as a basic is interesting, and once I heard about DevOps. I like the methodology and its principles. Automation – “don't touch anything with your hands,” infrastructure, control, monitoring. I am very communicative, and this profession suits me very well. I am proactive, tenacious, and persistent. I suppose that there is nothing that cannot be learned, nothing is impossible, and all boundaries are only are only in our heads. I have ambitious dreams that I turn into plans, when I have fulfilled some, I make others, an endless cycle of development.
